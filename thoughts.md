1. Some food items do not have their calorie values directly provided, but these can be calculated from their macronutrients.

2. The query parser, though currently simple, could be enhanced by adding an LLM to categorize different lifestyles, for example, keto: fat > x and carbs < y. I experimented with this today (as reflected in the database schema). I decided to keep the current parser for now, as using an LLM introduced some unresolved issues, but improving it would be a natural next step.

3. Inference time could be significantly reduced by using the Groq API (tested locally, it works), which would also lower costs substantially.
