2. The query parser, though currently simple, could be enhanced by adding an LLM to categorize different lifestyles, for example, keto: fat > x and carbs < y. I experimented with this today (as reflected in the database schema). I decided to keep the current parser for now, as using an LLM introduced some unresolved issues, but improving it would be a natural next step.

3. Using the Groq API has significantly improved speed, with responses now consistently under 5 seconds. You can experiment with different models in the Groq node within n8n.
